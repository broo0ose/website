&lt;p>In 1910, a ten tunnel deviation was completed and the Great Lithgow Zig Zag closed and the original formation was declared as a reserve by the Crown. 60 something years later, Zig Zag Railway was born.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many will remember Zig Zag Railway from their childhood – riding the train in the 70s, 80s or 90s. Come and relive the magic of steam trains and admire how much it has changed (and hasn’t) since you last came aboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Early Television Museum</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/na/us/early-television-museum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:36:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/na/us/early-television-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Early Television Foundation is dedicated to the preservation of the technology from the early days of television.

If you know where to look, you can follow it across the town centre as it surfaces and dips underground again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Start by Berkeley Avenue at the junction with Rose Kiln Lane (marked location). Walk downstream, until the Holy Brook dips under the ring road. You can cross the road using the footbridge in Cheriton Court. Pick up the Brook as it &lt;a href="https://osm.org/go/eusk_HMxD?m=">surfaces&lt;/a>, through the old brewery site (now housing), before dipping underground again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, walk up Bridge Street and turn into Gun Street. You can see the next open stretch of the stream from the &lt;a href="https://osm.org/go/eusk_1Efp?m=">entrance to the Oracle shopping centre&lt;/a>. The stream then goes under the telephone exchange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory, the next time it&amp;rsquo;s visible is through the glass roundel in the floor of the &lt;a href="https://osm.org/go/eusk~ir08?m=">King&amp;rsquo;s Arcade on King Street&lt;/a>, but that area is now occupied by a shop, and the lights that lit up the stream are no longer working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next time it&amp;rsquo;s visible is for a couple of metres, directly in front of the entrance to the &lt;a href="https://osm.org/go/eusk~qUyI?m=">Reading Central Library&lt;/a>, before running under the library, coming up again for a longer stretch behind the library. This is where the old abbey had its mill wheel, and &lt;a href="https://osm.org/go/eusk~rupm?m=">part of the structure&lt;/a> is still visible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it dips under the Abbey House office block, before &lt;a href="https://osm.org/go/eusmVDQnm?m=">rejoining the Kennet&lt;/a> at the back of the former Reading Gaol.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fire Services Museum</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/oc/au/fire-services-museum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:31:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/oc/au/fire-services-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>The museum has a very extensive collection of firefighting memorabilia, equipment and appliances, and is housed in the original Melbourne Fire Brigade HQ.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Region 6 War Room</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/region-6-war-room/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:28:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/region-6-war-room/</guid><description>&lt;p>WW2 Era bunker.

What makes this place special is that you&amp;rsquo;re literally standing in the rooms where they tracked enemy aircraft during WWII and Soviet spy planes during the Cold War.
The real highlight is the complete Cold War Operations Room, preserved exactly as it was when they decommissioned it in 2004. This is where fighter controllers would scramble jets to intercept aerial intruders during the tensest moments of the Cold War. The original radar equipment is still there, complete with the plotting boards and communication systems they used to coordinate air defence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bentwaters Cold War Museum</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/the-bentwaters-cold-war-museum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 06:54:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/the-bentwaters-cold-war-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Bentwaters Cold War Museum is housed in a former USAF hardened command post building, the only one of its kind open to the public in Europe. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just some converted hangar - it&amp;rsquo;s the actual bunker where they would have coordinated nuclear deterrence operations during the Cold War.
What makes it properly nerdy is that volunteers spent three years restoring the main War Operations Room and Battle Cabin to their original condition, complete with decontamination showers and airlocks meant to keep personnel safe in the event of nuclear war. You&amp;rsquo;re literally walking through a facility designed to function during World War III.
The 81st Fighter Wing was based here for over 40 years from 1951-1993, operating everything from F-86 Sabres to A-10 Warthogs. Outside there&amp;rsquo;s a decent collection of actual aircraft including a Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt, Hawker Hunter, McDonnell Douglas Phantom, and Bristol Bloodhound missile.
They&amp;rsquo;re only open certain Sundays (check the website)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Woodbridge Tide Mill</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/woodbridge-tide-mill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 06:30:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/woodbridge-tide-mill/</guid><description>&lt;p>Woodbridge Tide Mill is one of those brilliantly simple pieces of engineering. It&amp;rsquo;s a working flour mill that&amp;rsquo;s been grinding grain using nothing but the River Deben&amp;rsquo;s tides for centuries.
What makes this one special is that it&amp;rsquo;s still actually working - the wheel turns and you can buy flour that was ground there. Most other tide mills around the coast are either ruins or static museum displays.
It&amp;rsquo;s right in Woodbridge town center, so you can easily combine it with wandering the quayside and checking out the boats. Worth timing your visit for when they&amp;rsquo;re actually milling if you want to see the whole mechanism in action.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ipswich Transport Museum</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/ipswich-transport-museum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 06:30:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/ipswich-transport-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ipswich Transport Museum houses over 100 vehicles and engineering pieces with local connections - basically everything that moved people around this part of Suffolk or got built here over the decades. What started as one preserved bus 50 years ago has quietly become one of the more complete regional transport collections, looked after by volunteers who actually know their stuff.
They&amp;rsquo;re not open daily so check before you go, but when they do run special events you can sometimes get rides on the restored vehicles around town. Worth a look if you&amp;rsquo;re into seeing how local transport networks actually worked, rather than just reading about them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Flight in the UK</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/first-flight-in-the-uk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/first-flight-in-the-uk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Memorial to the first flight by SF Cody in 1908.&lt;/p>

It was the Danish dendrologist Carl-Gustaf Thøgersen’s idea to establish the world’s northernmost arboretum in Baggböle. Carl-Gustaf, who came to Umeå University in 1974 to study, had previously worked in various arboreta and felt that northern Sweden lacked a place dedicated to botanical and dendrological science. He emphasized the importance of research material for both education and studies, but also for landscape architects, garden technicians, foresters and a wide range of educational activities in society. The location would also provide Umeå with a new recreational area where visitors could enjoy exotic tree species in the company of the river landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our main arboretum is located about 10 km outside of Umeå city in the small village Baggböle. It is positioned in a scenic landscape right next to the swirling white rapids of the Umeå river. With Baggböle manor in the center, the arboretum occupies a 1 km stretch of the steep slope along the northern shore of the river. The south-facing exposure and the close proximity to the water make the growing conditions very favorable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today its a well grown beautiful park landscape with winding stairs crossing the slope. Its a big park about 1 km long with zones for different continents. Well worth a visit to learn about.. trees?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lost Railway Museum</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/na/us/the-lost-railway-museum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 20:23:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/na/us/the-lost-railway-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>This museum explores the history or electric interurban railroads in southern Michigan, all of which no longer exist today.

With the rich forests, there were all the conditions for a flourishing ironworks. In the 17th century, Högbo Bruk became a center for iron production, a place where development took place and wealth was created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Högbo Bruk is best known as the place where Consul Göransson forged the first Bessemer steel in 1858 and revolutionized steel production. Göransson&amp;rsquo;s steel became a worldwide success and he started a completely new industrial company from the ironworks in Högbo. Thus, a 200-year-long era ended and another began. New owners took over and the mill was given new purposes such as agriculture and summer entertainment. Högbo Bruk is today an open outdoor paradise, a living cultural heritage and an important cog in society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consul Göransson then? Well, things went well for him and his new steel mill, which has developed into the world-renowned industrial group Sandvik. Not bad!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>West Berkshire Museum</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/west-berkshire-museum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 20:22:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/gb/west-berkshire-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>A small, free (but donations welcomed) museum.

&lt;p>First open to the public in 1900 as a showplace, the guides told the Victorians history of Romans, Druids and Saxons, Smuggling and Murder. The last 100 years has added munitions storage for the Woolwich Arsenal in the 1914-18 war, Mushroom growing in the 1920 and 1930’s and becoming an underground town as the largest deep air-raid shelter outside London, protecting over 15000 people every night during the Blitz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 1950’s, 1960’s and 1970’s the caves were used as a venue for dances and concerts, presenting the foundations of Jazz, Skiffle and Folk music to the most famous names in pop and rock.&lt;/p>

Originally intended as a burial place for the Staufen family, the Benedictine monastery was lavishly endowed and became a prominent landmark. The Romanesque structure featured two towering church spires, symbolizing its royal origins, and was designed in the shape of a cross, incorporating essential buildings like a cloister and farmyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late Middle Ages, the monastery experienced a revival, characterized by the addition of a late Gothic rib vault and ornate decor, just before the Reformation led to its dissolution in the 16th century, transforming it into a Protestant site. Despite its decline, the legacy of the House of Staufen persisted, and efforts were made to preserve the monastery church as it fell into disrepair. Today, Lorch Monastery has been revitalized and offers unique tours, allowing visitors to appreciate its rich history and stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The site stands as a testament to the enduring heritage of the Staufen family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ries Crater Museum</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/de/rieskrater-museum/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 10:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/de/rieskrater-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>The RiesCraterMuseum is a natural science museum with the central theme of the formation and significance of impact craters and the crater “Nördlinger Ries” in particular.

&lt;p>From Wikipedia:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hotel del Coronado, also known as The Del and Hotel Del, is a historic beachfront hotel in Coronado, California, just across San Diego Bay from San Diego. A rare surviving example of an American architectural genre—the wooden Victorian beach resort—it was designated a California Historical Landmark in 1970 and a National Historic Landmark in 1977. It is the second-largest wooden structure in the United States (after the Tillamook Air Museum in Tillamook, Oregon).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the hotel opened in 1888, it was the largest resort hotel in the world. It has hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and been featured in numerous films and books.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Museum 't Kromhout</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/nl/museum-t-kromhout/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 18:03:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/nl/museum-t-kromhout/</guid><description>&lt;p>Former shipyard where also engines were built.

Johnson Space Center stands out as a uniquely compelling destination for those interested in space exploration, primarily because it functions as both an active NASA facility and a historical archive. Unlike conventional space museums, JSC offers direct access to working mission control centers, astronaut training facilities, and flight hardware, all within real ongoing space operations. The historic Mission Control Center, meticulously preserved from the Apollo era, provides tangible insight into the engineering and decision-making behind the Moon landings. At the same time, the adjacent modern control room demonstrates how International Space Station operations are conducted today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What makes the site particularly valuable is its collection of primary artifacts, including an authentic Saturn V rocket, lunar samples, and flown spacecraft like the Apollo 17 command module. These aren’t replicas or simulations—they’re the actual vehicles and hardware that supported human spaceflight missions. The facility also houses critical training infrastructure, such as the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, where astronauts currently prepare for spacewalks, and mockups of next-generation spacecraft like Orion. The tours provide access to normally restricted areas, offering a rare view of NASA’s operational workflow rather than a curated exhibit experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a technical perspective, JSC’s ongoing role in Artemis program development and commercial crew operations ensures that visitors observe not just historical achievements, but also current advancements in spaceflight. The opportunity to occasionally interact with active astronauts or flight controllers further enhances the experience, providing direct engagement with the people executing these missions. For anyone invested in space exploration, the center delivers an unusually substantive look at both the legacy and future of human spaceflight, with minimal separation between the visitor and the actual processes that enable it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Carl-Zeiss-Planetarium</title><link>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/de/carl-zeiss-planetarium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 15:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NerdyDayTrips.github.io/website/pr-1016/daytrip/eu/de/carl-zeiss-planetarium/</guid><description>&lt;p>The digital 360° full-dome projection system with nine high-performance projectors enables impressive forms of scientific presentation in the planetarium.Flights through the depths of space can be impressively displayed on the basis of huge databases, planets, galaxies, space probes and many other celestial bodies can be shown in great detail.

We take you around Brösarp&amp;rsquo;s hills, along the clear blue waters of Hanöbukten, the ripe fields, and through the deep beech forests. The Museum Association Skånska Järnvägar preserves and develops the museum railway on Österlen and showcases a time period when people traveled on wooden benches, the station master was the king of the community, and the locomotive driver was every child&amp;rsquo;s idol.&lt;/p>

Look for stone bluffs, sometimes with tool marks. Behind the turning pond are the ruins of a stonecutting mill, and traces of a narrow-gauge railway used to transport stone. Nearby are old fence foundations that had stood in DC&amp;rsquo;s Lafayette Park and were returned to their source. If you hike to the Bull Run Culvert, and follow Bull Run upstream into a gulch, you will be in the remains of the Bull Run Quarry, the source of the red sandstone used in the construction of the Smithsonian Castle and many other buildings in Washington and Baltimore. Sharp explorers may spot places were houses or buildings once stood, and a cemetery for quarry workers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Vagrarian said:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> The best time to explore is in late fall, winter, and early spring; in warm months the area is overgrown with creepers and brambles and is impassable. Further information can be found in the book &amp;quot;The Smithsonian Castle and the Seneca Quarry&amp;quot; by Garrett Peck.

Conrad City sprang up in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s when John Conrad began mining gold &amp;amp; silver ore from nearby Montana Mountain. The ore was hauled off of the mountain in an 80 ore bucket cable tramway. The tram terminated in Conrad City where the ore was loaded on to river boats and eventually on to the White Pass &amp;amp; Yukon Rail headed for smelters down south. In its heyday, Conrad City was home to more than 500 people.

It is housed in Dr. Evermore&amp;rsquo;s Art Park on Highway 12, in the town of Sumpter, in Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sculpture incorporates two Thomas Edison dynamos from the 1880s, lightning rods, high-voltage components from 1920s power plants, scrap from the nearby Badger Army Ammunition Plant, and the decontamination chamber from the Apollo 11 spacecraft.[2] Its fictional creator, Dr. Evermor, was born Tom Every[3] in Brooklyn, Wisconsin and is a former demolition expert who spent decades collecting antique machinery for the sculpture and the surrounding fiction that justifies it. According to Every, Dr. Evermor is a Victorian inventor who designed the Forevertron to launch himself, &amp;ldquo;into the heavens on a magnetic lightning force beam.&amp;rdquo; The Forevertron, despite its size and weight, was designed to be relocatable to a different site—the sculpture is built in sections that are connected by bolts and pins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the Forevertron itself, the sculpture includes a tea house gazebo from which Every says Queen Victoria and Prince Albert may observe the launching of Dr. Evermor; it also includes a giant telescope where sceptics may observe the ascent. Dr. Evermor&amp;rsquo;s art park is home to scores of other sculptures, many of which relate to the Forevertron, such as the &amp;ldquo;Celestial Listening Ear&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Overlord Master Control Tower&amp;rdquo;. Other large-scale sculptures include gigantic insects (the &amp;ldquo;Juicer Bug&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Arachna Artie&amp;rdquo;), the &amp;ldquo;Epicurean&amp;rdquo; bellows-driven barbecue train, &amp;ldquo;The Dragon&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;The UFO&amp;rdquo;. The most numerous sculptures are the &amp;ldquo;Bird Band and Orchestra&amp;rdquo; which includes nearly 70 birds ranging from the size of a child to twenty feet tall, all made from scrap industrial parts, geological survey markers, knives, loudspeakers, springs, and musical instruments, among other salvaged materials.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From the website:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ridgefield NWR has a total of 5,218 acres of marshes, grasslands and woodlands. Preservation of the natural Columbia River floodplain is the management objective of the Carty (2-mile self guided hiking trail), Roth and Ridgeport Dairy units. The River &amp;lsquo;S&amp;rsquo; (4.2 mile auto tour route and 1.2 mile seasonal hiking trail) and Bachelor Island units are managed to maximize habitat for waterfowl and other wetland wildlife.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The refuge was established, along with 3 other refuges in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, to secure vital winter habitat for Dusky Canada geese and other wintering waterfowl. With subsequent changes to nesting habitat and reduction in dusky populations following the violent earthquake of 1964 in Alaska, the need for secure wintering habitat became even more important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stately sandhill cranes, shorebirds, and a great variety of songbirds stop at the Refuge during spring and fall migrations. Some bird species such as mallards, great blue herons, and red-tailed hawks are year-round residents that nest on the refuge. Black-tailed deer are the largest mammal on the refuge. Coyote, raccoon, skunk, beaver, river otter and brush rabbits are occasionally seen.&lt;/p>

&lt;pre>&lt;code> The temperature is always roughly 70 degrees, so you can visit all year long and walk around inside with shorts and a t-shirt. Make sure you bring someone who knows what they're doing or it is a scary possibility that you may get lost. Bring HEADLAMPS, and flashlights and (if you want more fun) lots of glowsticks! Glowsticks are really useful for marking your path too. Theres a room at the end of the 'trail' where there is a book that you can sign your name in, while reading through the messages of the others who've been there before you. The only thing is you WILL get muddy. the whole cave is moist, covered in mud on the floors ceiling and walls. Sometimes you will have to use your hands to support yourself, and in one particular spot you need to get down and crawl through an opening, and then squeeze sideways through another opening. Not to be rude, but this leads me to another thing... Don't go if you have a rather 'wide' figure. You have to be thin to fit through some of the passageways. Bring towels to sit on on the way back in the car, and extra water to wash off with upon exiting. Don't bother bringing much into the cave, you wont use it. Maybe one snack, one waterbottle, and a camera, and some glowsticks will do. Your pack will get covered in mud as well. Overall, a very fun daytrip and I've been several times! Kudos if you read this whole thing.

It was built at the edge of a marsh for Gloucester’s first settled minister, the Reverend John White (1677–1760). In keeping with White’s esteemed position in the community, the House exhibits a certain elegance and refinement, perhaps best reflected in the surviving interior details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1735, the house was purchased by James Stevens and kept as a tavern, sometimes serving as a meeting place for the town’s selectmen. In 1740, Captain William Ellery (1693–1771) took title to the property. Ellery, who was almost 50 years old, had just married for the second time and after keeping the tavern in operation for a few years, used the house as a home for his growing family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the next 200 years, six generations of the Ellery family lived in the house-a remarkable record of longevity. At the most basic level, the house tells the story of an ordinary, middle-class New England family who worked hard to provide for themselves and to raise their children, who witnessed and often took part in events of local and national importance, and who sought to preserve their legacy in the face of an ever changing world. At a broader level, the house serves as a rare and thought-provoking venue for students of all ages to explore the evolution of New England architecture and to better understand how changing tastes and housing needs affected one particular structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The structure remained in its original location until 1947 when it was moved approximately 100 yards to make room for Route 128. Although the center of Gloucester long ago moved from the Town Green to the Harbor Village, the site remains the entrance to Gloucester and an important historical site.&lt;/p>

Inspired by California&amp;rsquo;s mythic, historic, and cultural roots, the garden consists of nine large-scale sculptures, a circular &amp;ldquo;snake wall&amp;rdquo; and maze entryway, sculpturally integrated bench seating, and native shrubs and trees planted within the interior plaza and along the outer perimeter. The garden bears the brilliant, unique mosaic ornamentation that is an unmistakable part of Saint Phalle&amp;rsquo;s later work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Queen Califia&amp;rsquo;s Magical Circle is situated within a 12-acre natural habitat in the Iris Sankey Arboretum in Kit Carson Park. The park&amp;rsquo;s entrance is located five minutes from I-15 (Via Rancho Parkway Exit) at the corner of Bear Valley Parkway and Mary Lane. Kit Carson Park also includes a frisbee golf course, playgrounds, and plenty of picnic areas. Though the park is open every day, please check the website for the hours of the sculpture garden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quidi Vidi Historical
