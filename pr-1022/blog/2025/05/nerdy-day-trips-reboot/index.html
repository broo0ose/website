&nbsp;|&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-user"></i>&nbsp;Alan Pope</span></header><hr><h1 id=back-online>Back online</h1><p>After years of &ldquo;we should really bring back Nerdy Day Trips&rdquo; conversations, we&rsquo;ve actually done it. The beloved crowd-sourced map of fascinating places to visit is back, rebuilt from the ground up.</p><p>For those who remember the original site, this should feel familiar. For newcomers, you&rsquo;re looking at a global map of intellectually interesting destinations - science museums, observatories, maker spaces, research facilities, and other places worth visiting if you&rsquo;re curious about the world.</p><h2 id=what-weve-built>What we&rsquo;ve built</h2><p>The new site runs on Hugo, a static site generator, which means it&rsquo;s fast, reliable, and won&rsquo;t disappear overnight like the original did. We&rsquo;ve designed everything to be open-source and community-owned, learning from what happened before.</p><p>Stuart&rsquo;s work recovering data from the Internet Archive gave us a foundation to build on, and we&rsquo;ve made sure all the code and data is openly available.</p><h2 id=where-we-are>Where we are</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s what works:</p><ul><li><strong>The concept is rescued</strong>: The original went offline in 2016, but the idea was too good to leave dead</li><li><strong>Data recovery</strong>: We&rsquo;ve salvaged what we could from archives and are rebuilding the database</li><li><strong>Modern foundation</strong>: Everything is version-controlled, open-source, and built to last</li><li><strong>Community focus</strong>: Every decision prioritizes sustainability and community ownership</li><li><strong>Open data</strong>: All location information remains freely accessible</li></ul><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next</h2><p>The core functionality works well, but there&rsquo;s more to build:</p><ul><li><strong>Easier submissions</strong>: Adding locations currently requires GitHub knowledge, but we&rsquo;re planning web forms</li><li><strong>Design improvements</strong>: The site works but could look better</li><li><strong>Mobile optimization</strong>: Making it work smoothly on phones</li><li><strong>Community features</strong>: Ways for people to connect and share experiences</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-help>How to help</h2><p>This succeeds through community contributions:</p><p><strong>Add places</strong>: Know an interesting observatory, quirky museum, or hidden scientific gem? Add it to the map.</p><p><strong>Spread the word</strong>: Tell other curious people about the site.</p><p><strong>Contribute skills</strong>: Whether you&rsquo;re a developer, designer, writer, or just have good ideas, there&rsquo;s probably something you can help with.</p><p><strong>Join the conversation</strong>: Connect with us on social media and help shape what we build next.</p><h2 id=why-were-doing-this>Why we&rsquo;re doing this</h2><p>We believe in curiosity and community. Every location on the map represents someone&rsquo;s enthusiasm for sharing interesting places with others. We&rsquo;re building something that celebrates the joy of discovery and makes it easier for curious people to find their next adventure.</p><p>The original Nerdy Day Trips inspired countless visits and learning experiences. This reboot continues that legacy while ensuring it can survive long-term.</p><p>Ready to explore? Check out the <a href=../../../../>map</a> and see what&rsquo;s near you. Better yet, add somewhere you think others should know about.</p><p>Welcome to the community.</p><hr><a href=https://github.com/nerdydaytrips/website/edit/main/content/blog/2025/05/nerdy-day-trips-reboot.md rel=external><i class='fa-solid fa-pen-to-square'>&nbsp;</i>Edit on GitHub</a></article><hr><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=next><a href=../../../../website/pr-1022/blog/2025/05/an-amazing-start/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="An Amazing Start">Next post &rarr;</a></li></ul></main><footer id=footer></footer></body><script src=https://kit.fontawesome.com/06412a75a5.js crossorigin=anonymous></script></html>
