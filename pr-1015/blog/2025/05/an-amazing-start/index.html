&nbsp;|&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-user"></i>&nbsp;Alan Pope</span></header><hr><h1 id=what-a-week>What a week!</h1><p>First, <strong>thank you</strong> to everyone who has <a href=https://add.nerdydaytrips.org/>added</a> new venues, filed <a href=https://github.com/NerdyDayTrips/website/issues>bugs</a>, reviewed & edited locations, and provided feedback and support. Thank you <em>so</em> much. I had no idea whether people would actually want to contribute to something like this. I&rsquo;m <em>delighted</em> you all have.</p><p>We have had contributions from around the globe, including from the USA, UK, Japan, Croatia, Germany, Canada, and no doubt more I missed.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve also had conversations with other people who were also enthusiastic to revive this type of resource. I had no idea other people were so passionate about this too! That&rsquo;s so validating to hear.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve made a bunch of changes over the last week, mostly around the look of the site, the logo, and the process for adding new venues. There&rsquo;s more to do there, though. If you know a nearby friendly web developer with CSS smarts, I&rsquo;d appreciate their input/help to make a good looking, robust and responsive website.</p><p>The site was <em>somewhat</em> thrown together (as you can probably tell), so I&rsquo;m sure there are bugs on mobile devices and desktop browsers.</p><h2 id=adding-sites-with-copy--paste>Adding sites with copy & paste</h2><p>I wanted to make adding new venues straightforward, but not too easy that we get flooded with spam submissions. It&rsquo;s important to me (and I&rsquo;m sure to you too) that non-nerds and nerds alike are able to share their favourite or recently discovered locations as easily as possible.</p><p>So, with that in mind, today, I added the ability on the <a href=https://add.nerdydaytrips.org/>add a venue</a> page to just paste an <a href=https://openstreetmap.org/>Open Street Map</a> (OSM) URL in, and have our site pick out the lat/long and other details, directly from OSM.</p><p><a href=../../../../images/2025/05/add-with-osm-url.png><div class=center><img src=../../../../images/2025/05/add-with-osm-url-thumb.png alt="The new submission option" decoding=async></div></a></p><p>It does require an OSM <a href=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way>way</a> style URL, which often isn&rsquo;t just the link your browser shows. However, they&rsquo;re easy to discover on the OSM site.</p><blockquote><p>When on OSM, click the little arrow-with-question-mark icon in the toolbar, then point at the venue you wish to add. On the left will be a pop-out panel with &ldquo;Nearby features&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Enclosing features&rdquo;. Pick the most appropriate &ldquo;way&rdquo;, and your URL will update. That&rsquo;s the one to paste into <a href=https://add.nerdydaytrips.org/>add a venue</a> page.</p></blockquote><p>If there are problems with this new feature, do let us know with an <a href=https://github.com/NerdyDayTrips/website/issues>issue</a> report, or jump on our <a href=https://discord.gg/VJKJ5EzgXA>Discord</a> server to chat directly with us.</p><h2 id=managing-duplicates>Managing duplicates</h2><p>One other thing I haven&rsquo;t quite figured out yet, but plan to, is dealing with duplicate submissions. For example, we had three submissions for <a href=https://nerdydaytrips.org/daytrip/eu/gb/bletchley-park/>Bletchley Park</a> in one day.</p><p>Ideally the page where you add new venues should have the smarts to do that duplicate search for you and respond with &ldquo;We already have venue x (with a link)&rdquo;, with options to edit it in GitHub, or add the new site anyway, in case the search is wrong, or the new addition compliments or supplements the existing ones nearby.</p><h2 id=rejection-feedback>Rejection feedback</h2><p>I am also aware that the site doesn&rsquo;t provide any feedback to submitters whose venues were not accepted. This is unfortunately a by-product of not really wanting to know and store all your personal details, such as an email address, to tell you about the rejection. I don&rsquo;t want to have the burden of carrying everyone&rsquo;s personal data, and emailing people.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll start a topic over on <a href=https://github.com/NerdyDayTrips/website/discussions>GitHub Discussions</a> if anyone has any bright ideas!</p><h2 id=thanks-again>Thanks again</h2><p>Once more, massive thanks to everyone who has helped this week.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to discuss anything in this blog, join our <a href=https://discord.gg/VJKJ5EzgXA>Discord</a> or start a topic in our <a href=https://github.com/NerdyDayTrips/website/discussions>GitHub Discussions</a></p><p>Oh, and keep on <a href=https://add.nerdydaytrips.org/>adding venues</a>!</p><hr><a href=https://github.com/nerdydaytrips/website/edit/main/content/blog/2025/05/an-amazing-start.md rel=external><i class='fa-solid fa-pen-to-square'>&nbsp;</i>Edit on GitHub</a></article><hr><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=../../../../website/pr-1015/blog/2025/05/nerdy-day-trips-reboot/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bringing Back Nerdy Day Trips">&larr; Previous post</a></li><li class=next><a href=../../../../website/pr-1015/blog/2025/06/over-300/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Venues added: Over 300...">Next post &rarr;</a></li></ul></main><footer id=footer></footer></body><script src=https://kit.fontawesome.com/06412a75a5.js crossorigin=anonymous></script></html>
