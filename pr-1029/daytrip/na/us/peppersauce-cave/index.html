    The temperature is always roughly 70 degrees, so you can visit all year long and walk around inside with shorts and a t-shirt. Make sure you bring someone who knows what they're doing or it is a scary possibility that you may get lost. Bring HEADLAMPS, and flashlights and (if you want more fun) lots of glowsticks! Glowsticks are really useful for marking your path too. Theres a room at the end of the 'trail' where there is a book that you can sign your name in, while reading through the messages of the others who've been there before you. The only thing is you WILL get muddy. the whole cave is moist, covered in mud on the floors ceiling and walls. Sometimes you will have to use your hands to support yourself, and in one particular spot you need to get down and crawl through an opening, and then squeeze sideways through another opening. Not to be rude, but this leads me to another thing... Don't go if you have a rather 'wide' figure. You have to be thin to fit through some of the passageways. Bring towels to sit on on the way back in the car, and extra water to wash off with upon exiting. Don't bother bringing much into the cave, you wont use it. Maybe one snack, one waterbottle, and a camera, and some glowsticks will do. Your pack will get covered in mud as well. Overall, a very fun daytrip and I've been several times! Kudos if you read this whole thing.
